                    happy hanging up. Because seeing your face and knowing how much you love me makes me feel like everything will be okay.
                    <br><br> I have never been this happy when I’m with you and I have never been this sad every time we have to say goodbye. I love you even more than I could have imagined. And it’s in this moment of sheer sadness that I realized that.
                    Because I find happiness in a lot of other things but this is the first time that I have such a deep understanding of sadness. There are so many things I miss about you: the first time you kissed me and every kiss ever since. Your
                    hair, your eyes, your smile. But that will only make me look forward to seeing you again. I love you.”

                    with my flaws. We are different like fire and rain; and I can’t be more grateful that understanding and comprise bind us together. Lasting love is the one that cultivated by both of us.”

                    friends to you. But the truth is, I’m not. I’m not ready to just let you go. I know you probably can tell that I still have strong feelings for you. Do you still have feelings for me? Did you already let that feeling in your heart
                    die out, or do you still hold it deep down and try to suppress it?
                    <br> No matter how many times you said you just want to be friends with me, the moment when you talk to me, when our hands touch, when we look into each other’s eyes, I can feel clearly there’s still something behind that lie of “just
                    wanna be friends”. Are you confused? Why do you want to kill your own feelings? I really wish you could talk to me about this. I really wish I could be with you, even if just for one night. I understand your worries about future and
                    everything, but I want to give it a shot.”</p>

                    <br> This is what you are now: a loose imprint on my skin.
                    <br> And right now, I wish nothing more but to make sure you feel the multitudes I feel for the air you give me.
                    <br> Even though we have each other in ruins, we know that it is better to have run our hands on the ripples of the Notre Dame or Al-Aqsa than not at all because we know there is nothing that can bring them back once they are burning.
                    <br> So debris simmering, I puncture a hole in the sky with the remaining spire and minaret and hope that one day the sun will fill it and will drag across the sky with its diamond beams, cutting it, and so when I untuck the frayed
                    fabric, the shadow will burst inside the outline I have traced thousands of times, and you will be there.
                    <br> When there are days no light branches and I am alone, you whisper holy words to me, and I secure myself between them knowing very well they will flash as instantaneously as the time we have spent while our lives were one.
                    <br> If only there was an apparatus that could pry the earth in half and magnetize our lives on each slice back together again — but for now, I am stuck here writing this to you while the imprint is lifting and the world is still whole
                    and gnawed.”

                    in the unisex bathroom on the third floor. Out of the haze, I see only your light. In the smog of Shanghai, you are the only bright moonlight and cool breeze, the only sunshine from cold rains. Your smile hugs my inconfidence ever-so
                    softly, and your melody melts the coldness in my heart gradually. I really really love you, and I hope you can know that.”

                    <br> It’s been a while.
                    <br> Thinking of you used to be something so unbearable that I would do many things to avoid it. From time to time, grief still nudges me from unprecedented angles, reminding me of what once was.
                    <br> As the arrow of time flies further from when you were around, however, it has become a bit easier for me to acknowledge this loss.
                    <br> I would like to thank you for all that you did for me. You sacrificed so much for me to have a happy childhood, and for me to be who I am now.
                    <br> Also, thank you for the 9 letters you have left behind; while a few remain unopened, from the ones I have read I am learning new things about you and about myself.
                    <br> Our days together ended too early, leaving me heartbroken. Yet your presence in the first 16 years of my life has left me inspired.
                    <br> As life moves on, I will take every opportunity to love others as I have been loved by you.

                    in such an accidental way. I didn’t even have a chance to say goodbye, or good luck to you, officially, with a smile.
                    <br> You were a fantasy to me. I admired you , looked up to you, learned from you, and most importantly, loved you. But I wasn’t brave enough to tell you that. I was afraid you would be scared away. I wish I could have a chance to
                    look into your eyes and say it out loud. Just take a little bit more of my courage.
                    <br> I still remember after the last time we met, I wandered around on the Century Avenue. My thought went: “The last thing I want from you is to remember me.” It repeated, repeated, and repeated.
                    <br> It is also the reason I want to write this letter. I hope I can always remember you. And when I think of you, I can always be smiling, be strong, and be thankful.”</p>

                    <br> 展信佳。
                    <br> 本来不打算再和你讲话了，心里、笔下、社交软件，都不要了。但是看到要写情书，下笔写得却还全是你。哈，我也分不清是放不下，还是习惯下笔就是你了。10年前那封情书没亲手拿给你大概是我最后悔的事情之一，只是当时的我没有想到，更没想到十年之后的我们已然是陌路了。
                    <br> 所以，大概是这种后悔驱动了4年前的那场告白。彻夜长谈里，最无力的那句大概就是“你怎么不早告诉我”了。“没有勇气”，拖垮了你我的最后一点可能。时至今日，你在我的这片混沌里，都是独一的，就算，我终于说服自己不再继续浇灌我对你的那份情感。
                    <br> 只是，因为那场告白，我也最终失去了联络你的权力，以朋友的名义。我不想你有任何的为难，尤其害怕有任何一点打扰到你，还有她。我不喜欢她，大眼睛却没有神采。只是她不开心的话，你也会难过的吧。所以啊，我一句话也没有说过了，一句也没有。我又不敢了，不敢轻易让你发现一丝一毫的想念；我纠结着，一面想让你以为我忘了你，一面怕你觉得当初我一字一句写给你的心思是一场笑话。但是，大概都没有所谓了吧，毕竟，你不在意，你也不会想起。
                    <br> 19年的春要结束了，离你22岁生日还有整整1月。又是别离的日子了呢，我不再那么想知道你的消息了，心里只有一个角落依然好奇着你的去处。不过，我大概不会再问了，我也是自私的人，我没有留下你，那么我就在主动离开了。
                    <br> 我过的一般，但也有星点的欢欣；我感谢你给我记忆里留下的那一捧细碎的温凉，难过的时候，他们最终还是我的药。不知道你怎么样了，何先生。就，希望你，身体安康、温暖坚定；希望你再也没有我的日子里，能常有笑容，一如你20岁坐在大连沙滩上的那一副。
                    <br> 祝，永远18岁。
                    <br> 希望可以再少些想起你的，

                    <br> "Mr. He,<br> I hope this letter finds you well.
                    <br> I was planning to not to talk to you anymore. In my heart, from my pen, and social media – not any more. However, when asked to write a love letter , all I think is about you. I can’t tell anymore if writing about you is my habit,
                    or I can’t let go. The thing I regret the most in the past ten years is that I did not give you the love letter I wrote to you. Little did I know that ten years later we do not talk to each other anymore.
                    <br> So, maybe it was the regret that drove me to tell you my true feelings. In our night-long conversation, the most feeble question was, “why didn’t you tell me earlier?”. No courage. Any possibilities between you and I extinguished.
                    Even if I have persuaded myself to stop developing my feelings towards you, in this chaos, you are my only clarity.
                    <br> Only that in my confession of the love towards you, I lost you as a friend forever. I don’t wish to put you in an uncomfortable position, especially I’m afraid of disturbing you. And her. Her eyes do not illuminate. But if she’s
                    unhappy, you will be unhappy too. So I have never spoken a word at all, not even one word. Yet I’m again afraid. I’m afraid that you will figure out even a little, my longing for you. I’m torn. On the one hand, I want to you to think
                    that I have forgotten you; on the other hand, I’m afraid you will think all the words I wrote to you is a joke. But it won’t matter anymore. After all, you do not care, and you will not think of me.
                    <br> The spring of 2019 is coming to an end, and it is exactly one month till your 22nd birthday. It’s time to say goodbye again. I don’t want to hear from you anymore, but there’s still one corner in my heart that is still curious
                    about where you will be heading next. However, I will probably not ask anymore. I’m selfish. I did not manage to make you stay, so I will leave myself.
                    <br> I’m doing ok, and sometimes my life still sparkles. I appreciate the tiny warm fragments you left in my memory, and when I’m sad, they remain my medicine. I wonder how your life is going, Mr. He. I wish you then to stay healthy,
                    determined, and warm. In your days without me, I hope you can still find happiness, just like your 20 year-old-self sitting on the beach in Dalian.
                    <br> Wishing you were forever 18 years old.
                    <br> Hoping to think of you less,
                    <br> Lulu”
